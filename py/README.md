# My python3 LeetCode solutions! 

Feel free to use any of the code in this repo for your own LeetCode solutions. *LeetCode scoring seems to be arbitrary, so don't blame me if the scores are less than ideal* 

I typically only redo a solution if either of the following occurs:
    1. **Both** time/memory beat **less** than 50%
    2. **Either** time/memory beats **less** than 10%, and the other doesn't sufficiently compensate (e.g. if speed beats 5% but space beats 99%, I don't mind too much)

I do like criticism though! If you think you have a cool solution to a problem that I've solved, feel free to let me know :)
